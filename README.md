# Auto.am - Group Project

The objective of this project is to help Toyota owners in Armenia to:
- set the price appropriately for their cars
when putting them on sale at auto.am
- understand whether or not the car
will be purchased soon given the
characteristics of the model

That is why we scraped data from auto.am with the following features:
  - location
  - price
  - custom
  - payment option
  - mileage
  - hand drive
  - car body type
  
Afterwards, we generated a variable called "Perchased" based on two dataframes scraped
within 1 week difference in between. As a result we found out that 1000 out of 6700 cars were purchased. We used this variable
to predict if the car will be soon
purchased or not using predictive analytics.

Moreover, we used different models to predict the price of a car.

Models used for Regression and Classification are:
- Decision Tree
- Linear Regression
- Gradient Boosting
- Random Forest
- Neural Network

Group members of the project are:
- Hermine Grigoryan
- Gor Khachatryan
- Lilia Mamikonyan
